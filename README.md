# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-GUI-and-Sound-Effects

This is a rendition of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a visually appealing GUI using OpenCV. It is a two-player game with one player being the user and the other being a computer AI. The board is divided into a 3x3 grid where the players take turns to place their respective markers (`x` for the player and `o` for the computer). The game features:

1. **Sound Effects using Pygame**: The game incorporates various sound cues that play during specific events. These include player's move, computer's move, a draw situation, and victory sounds for either the player or the computer.
2. **AI Move Selection**: The computer opponent makes strategic moves. It will prioritize blocking the player from winning and, if possible, take winning moves.
3. **Timed Moves**: If the player doesn't make a move within 6 seconds, the computer AI automatically takes its turn.
4. **Restart and Quit**: Players can restart the game by pressing the 'R' key or exit using the 'ESC' key.
5. **Interactive GUI**: The game displays real-time updates on the Tic Tac Toe grid. Players can interact with the game board by clicking on the grid cells to place their marker.

To get started, simply run the main script and enjoy the game. Make sure to have OpenCV and Pygame installed and ensure sound files are placed in the same directory as the script for the full audiovisual experience.
